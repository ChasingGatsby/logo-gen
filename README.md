# Week 10: SVG Logo Generator ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  ## Description
  This week's project tasked us with creating an application that will create an SVG logo based on user input. We were required to use constructors/classes in order to create objects that could be used in the final output of the application, as well as create tests for the application.
  While the actual writing of the code was not particularly difficult, the hardest part came from having to shift my perspective to account for the requirements. I had originally used a switch function to manage all of the output code, but while I am still utilizing it, I realized creating classes made it easier to create tests for the application.
  I ended up writing tests after coding; I am still not completely onboard with the concept of writing tests for code beforehand, but perhaps I am not seeing the value due to being a solo developer.
  In the end, this project ended up being more of a refactor than a full from-scratch development. But the value of the weeks lessons was learned.
